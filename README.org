Lacquer is a util that switches theme and to configure cache ;)
ps: using it with `which-key' is recommended.

* Features
- Use both the theme seletor and the shortcut key to switch themes.
- Load previous theme after restarting the emacs.
- Each theme can be configured individually.
- Download unused themes automatically with package.el.
- Generate interactive function automatically.
